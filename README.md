# OtusIntel: Mitigating the risk under our feet
OtusIntel is a Sydney based Australian fintech company that specializes in risk management, property risk, and spatial data analytics [1]. The primary focus of the group is the use of satellite data to identify areas of ground movement, this data can be linked to property damage and can be used to identify areas of potential risk during property development or portfolio management. The company also claims the technology provids the potential to predict commodity prices and optimise crop production.

OtusIntel were founded in 2016 and have made headway into a variety of sectors including banking, valuations, Insurance, and legal. They offer a variety of property reports ranging from $250 AUD for a residential report, and up $999 AUD for commercial applications, update reports are also available to provide a temporal understanding of ground movement. The company provides a surface movement risk index which evaluates property risk based on data from over 9 million Australian properties.
# Why do we need this?
An ever increasing population and higher density cities is resulting in the need for better and more efficient housing, this also comes with a requirement of more infrastructure. Installation of highrise buildings with foundations that reach deep into bedrock and tunnelling for complex road networks has meant that the ground around us has never been more volatile.

Ground movement of just 10-15mm can cause significant damage to residential housing, without ground movement data, causation of damage can be difficult to prove in an insurance claim.
Additionally, movement during or after construction can cause the structure to fail to meet specification, leading to unforseen costs and budget blowouts [7].

# The technology behind the claims
The past 10 years has seen an explosion in the use of big data [4], coupled with the recent hype around space exploration[5], the data generated in space is receiving quite a lot of attention. OtusIntel use radiowave image data generated by satteliets [8] to track ground movement data, analysis of the data reveals surface level movements on the order of millimeters. Recently, the company has begun using machine learning in collaboration with spiralblue to implement machine learning into their workflow.



# Whoâ€™s the competition
OptaSense (ground movement for pipelines)
SatSense (ground movement for housing)
